# GRIB integration fixture

`gfs.2026081406.f000.crop.grib2` is an 80 by 80 cell crop of the NOAA GFS 0.25 degree
2 m temperature and surface precipitation rate records for the 2026-08-14 06:00 UTC run. It covers approximately
118E to 138E and 18N to 38N, including the browser test's initial viewport.

The fixture was created from the downloaded record with:

```sh
python -m xue fetch --run 2026081406 --hours 0
gdal_translate -srcwin 1192 208 80 80 -of GRIB \
  data/raw/gfs.2026081406/gfs.2026081406.f000.grib2 \
  tests/fixtures/gfs.2026081406.f000.crop.grib2
```

# Xue fixtures

`tests/prepare_bin_fixture.py` encodes the same cropped GRIB into per-variable
bundles `tests/fixtures/generated/tmp2m.xue` and `generated/prate.xue` plus
Python-decoded golden planes (`expected.<variable>.f000.bin`). The Rust tests
in `rust/xue/tests/golden.rs` and the browser tests in
`rust/xue-wasm/tests/web.rs` compare their decode output byte for byte
against those planes.

`tests/prepare_web_fixture.py` builds synthetic 121-frame per-variable bundles
on a coarse 144x73 global grid (`generated/web/tmp2m.xue`,
`generated/web/prate.xue`, half-resolution `<variable>.half.xue` variants,
posters, and a matching schema v5 `manifest.json` + `latest.json`) so
Playwright can exercise the full download, checksum, decode, on-demand variable
loading, and playback path with tiny payloads. It also builds a second,
independent ECMWF-identity dataset (`generated/web/ecmwf/` with 3-hourly
41-frame scalar bundles and `generated/web/latest-ecmwf.json`) so the model
switcher can be exercised end to end. Playwright global setup runs it
automatically. All generated files stay in ignored directories.
